# Swarmnoid
Yantra Swarmanoid is an open tournament in which the automatic robots revolve around in a pair completing the tasks together as a cohesive alliance to efficiently manage and sort garbage.
This interactive exhibit stressed the need of working together to mitigate the negative effects of manual solid waste.
This event was organized by Robotics Association of Nepal. 

This is an object oriented approach for work done by Mr. Spandan Guragain at : https://github.com/scientiac/swarmanoid
